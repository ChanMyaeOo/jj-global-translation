        text: 'Generally, for most language pairs, a 2 business-day turnaround is to be expected for small texts (up to 2,000 words). If the translation must be completed over weekends, or public holidays, and if higher volumes than 2,000 per day are involved then a premium for urgent (or rush) translation may be applied. It is very important to state the timeline required at the time of requesting a quotation.'

        text: 'The language combination itself has an impact on the speed and price of the translation. More common translation languages (such as Spanish-English, English-French) are substantially cheaper than less common ones (such as Finnish to Arabic). In the cases where multiple languages are required, often a volume discount can be applied.'

        text: 'The complexity (or lack thereof) the content will also adjust the price of the translation project. A complex document with industry-specific or technical terms will require the use of a specialised translator that has additional qualifications in the field and therefore a surcharge is often applied.'

        title: 'Translation Type',
        text: 'When an official translation is required, such as in the case of a legalised or sworn translation, there are additional steps involved in the process (sometimes including notarising the documents, procuring an Apostille, and posting hard-copies of the finalised translation). These additional steps have their associated costs.'

        title: 'Document Format',
        text: "Depending on how the documents are sent to Translator UK and how the final translation is required to be delivered can also impact the price. Standard text (sent via email, Microsoft Word documents, etc.) will generally incur no surcharge. provided the translation does not require additional typesetting or manipulating on the translator's part."
